# Raid-Zero-Programming-Guide

This is a quick guide to get started for the programming team. However, not everything may be mentioned here, because we value the ability to problem solve and RTFM (Read The Manual). Therefore, when you encounter a problem, use your brain a bit before asking for help. Most of the details mentioned in this document are mentioned in the wpilib screen steps live website. Use this [site](http://wpilib.screenstepslive.com/s/currentCS) if you need further information.
